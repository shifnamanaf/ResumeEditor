What are various Machine Learning models and Data mining patterns possible for analyzing the behavior of the users in a multimedia content sharing platform?

machine learning methods such as deep neural networks and KNN algorithms etc.. can be used for analyzing user behaviour.
Every person is different and so is their behavior.Unsupervised learning like K-means clustering can be used to cluster users according to their behaviour.
The process of identifying user behavior consisting of data collection, query parser, pre-processing and pattern analysis that will help us to analyze and predict the user behavior in short time.
