AWS MEDIA SERVICES
---------------------

AWS Media Services make it fast and easy to produce, process, and deliver broadcast and over-the-top video. 
These pay-as-you-go services and appliance products offer the video infrastructure you need to deliver great viewing experiences to any screen.

Services are:
1) AWS Elemental MediaConnect
   AWS Elemental MediaConnect is a high-quality transport service for live video.
   Today, broadcasters and content owners rely on satellite networks or fiber connections to send their high-value content into the cloud or to transmit it to partners for distribution.
   Both satellite and fiber approaches are expensive, require long lead times to set up, and lack the flexibility to adapt to changing requirements.
   To be more nimble, some customers have tried to use solutions that transmit live video on top of IP infrastructure, but have struggled with reliability and security.

2)AWS Elemental MediaConvert
    AWS Elemental MediaConvert is a file-based video transcoding service with broadcast-grade features.
    It allows you to easily create video-on-demand (VOD) content for broadcast and multiscreen delivery at scale. 
    The service combines advanced video and audio capabilities with a simple web services interface and pay-as-you-go pricing.
    With AWS Elemental MediaConvert, you can focus on delivering compelling media experiences without having to worry about the complexity of building and operating your own video processing infrastructure.

3)AWS Elemental Media Live
  AWS Elemental MediaLive is a broadcast-grade live video processing service.
 It lets you create high-quality video streams for delivery to broadcast televisions and internet-connected multiscreen devices, like connected TVs, tablets, smart phones, and set-top boxes. 
 The service works by encoding your live video streams in real-time, taking a larger-sized live video source and compressing it into smaller versions for distribution to your viewers. With AWS Elemental MediaLive, you can easily set up streams for both live events and 24x7 channels with advanced broadcasting features, high availability, and pay-as-you-go pricing. 
 AWS Elemental MediaLive lets you focus on creating compelling live video experiences for your viewers without the complexity of building and operating broadcast-grade video processing infrastructure.

4) AWS Elemental MediaPackage
   AWS Elemental MediaPackage reliably prepares and protects your video for delivery over the Internet.
   From a single video input, AWS Elemental MediaPackage creates video streams formatted to play on connected TVs, mobile phones, computers, tablets, and game consoles.
   It makes it easy to implement popular video features for viewers (start-over, pause, rewind, etc.), like those commonly found on DVRs.
   AWS Elemental MediaPackage can also protect your content using Digital Rights Management (DRM). 
   AWS Elemental MediaPackage scales automatically in response to load, so your viewers will always get a great experience without you having to accurately predict in advance the capacity you’ll need.

5) AWS Elemental MediaStore
   AWS Elemental MediaStore is an AWS storage service optimized for media. 
   It gives you the performance, consistency, and low latency required to deliver live streaming video content.
   AWS Elemental MediaStore acts as the origin store in your video workflow. Its high performance capabilities meet the needs of the most demanding media delivery workloads, combined with long-term, cost-effective storage.

6) AWS Elemental MediaTailor
   AWS Elemental MediaTailor lets video providers insert individually targeted advertising into their video streams without sacrificing broadcast-level quality-of-service.
   With AWS Elemental MediaTailor, viewers of your live or on-demand video each receive a stream that combines your content with ads personalized to them.
   But unlike other personalized ad solutions, with AWS Elemental MediaTailor your entire stream – video and ads – is delivered with broadcast-grade video quality to improve the experience for your viewers.
   AWS Elemental MediaTailor delivers automated reporting based on both client and server-side ad delivery metrics, making it easy to accurately measure ad impressions and viewer behavior. 
   You can easily monetize unexpected high-demand viewing events with no up-front costs using AWS Elemental MediaTailor. It also improves ad delivery rates, helping you make more money from every video, and it works with a wider variety of content delivery networks, ad decision servers, and client devices.

7)AWS Elemental Aplliances and Software
  AWS Elemental Appliances and Software solutions bring advanced video processing and delivery technologies into your data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility. 
  You can deploy AWS Elemental Appliances and Software to encode, package, and deliver video assets on-premises and seamlessly connect with cloud-based video infrastructure.
  Designed for easy integration with AWS Cloud media solutions, AWS Elemental Appliances and Software support video workloads that need to remain on-premises to accommodate physical camera and router interfaces, managed network delivery, or network bandwidth constraints.
